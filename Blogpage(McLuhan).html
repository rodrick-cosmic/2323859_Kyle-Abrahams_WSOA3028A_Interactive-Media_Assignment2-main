<h3>The Medium Is The Message, massage, or was it mass-age?</h3>

<p class="yellow-div"> Marshall McLuhan's seminal piece, The Medium Is The Message, is arguably one of the most prophetic and equally informative pieces of text in the 21st century. The phrase is somewhat paradoxical, shouldn't the medium be a mere vessel for the message? According to McLuhan, not really. McLuhan believes that it is better that we emphasis the content rather than its form, that what is communicated is far less important than the medium in which it was communicated through.

Take for instance a castaway who writes a letter and slips it into a bottle before throwing into the ocean. 

 The bottle floats endlessly through high tides, still seas and even other castaways. <br> Eventually </br> 


  
 
 The bottle washes ashore and a coast guard picks it up, the guard is stunned that the bottle was able to travel for as long as it has, he shows the bottle to his fellow coast guards and they all rejoice at this archaic sight, after much jubilation they break the bottle open and read the letter.

    Without the bottle, the letter would never have been received, without email, the letter would never have been received, without Facebook, the letter would never have been received, without Twitter, the letter would never have been received.
    The list goes on. McLuhan's understanding was that media affects society in the sense that it plays a role via the characteristics of the medium itself, and not so much the content delivered over the medium .McLuhan makes reference to a light bulb, which we can understand has no ‘content’, at least not in the way a blog posts has the writer’s opinions or thoughts or Netflix has different shows to choose from. The light bulb is  instead, a medium that has social effects, a light bulb gave people a chance to create spaces during night-time that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that a “light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence”, which I believe refers to how a light attracts audience as people seek out the light in the dark. Ideas are the same way.

    I believe McLuhan's writings have never been more relevant, as his ideas can be applied to our digital age and how we've essentially created a means of connecting means of people while also othering and dividing them.

    I believe McLuhan's writings have never been more relevant, as his ideas can be applied to our digital age and how we've essentially created a means of connecting means of people while also othering and dividing them. in truth we have created a much more perverse 'global village', one where not only our cultures are shrinking and expanding but so too are our privacy, discipline, attention and even emotional empathy.

    McLuhan warns us that we are often distracted by the content of a medium, that blinds us to the characteristics or context of the medium.  "This is merely that the personal and social consequences of any medium - that is, of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology." A relevant example would be the advent of smartphones which have no doubt drastically reshaped not only our ability to communicate but have also changed the way we communicate and apply knowledge we have circulated amongst ourselves. Studies have shown that there has been an increase in how little people write by hand, whereas some people even forget how to spell and even lose their skills to memorize and retain information. An interesting study by the Technical University of Denmark (Links to an external site.) found that a constant stream of information can narrow our collective attention span overtime. They also concluded that the peak of trends and hashtags has decreased dramatically over the years. “When looking into the global daily top 50 hashtags on Twitter, in 2013 a hashtag stayed in the top 50 for an average of 17.5 hours. This gradually decreases to 11.9 hours in 2016”. This constant need for faster information, new content and exciting daily trends is only continuing to grow. It sets up a bad precedent for the future of technology in relation to man and I think there is no right or wrong answer that can be discerned from the reading, I won't try come up with one , instead I will leave this quote as food for thought.

    "Every Roman was surrounded by slaves. The slave and his psychology flooded ancient Italy, and every Roman became inwardly, and of course unwittingly, a slave. Because living constantly in the atmosphere of slaves, he became infected through the unconscious with their psychology. No one can shield himself from such an influence.”
