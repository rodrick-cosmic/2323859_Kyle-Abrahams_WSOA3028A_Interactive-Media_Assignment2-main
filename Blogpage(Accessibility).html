<h3>What is accessibility, who does it affect and why does it matter?</h3>

<p class="yellow-div">
    
    What is accessibility, and why does it matter.

Before I answer this, I'd like to conduct something of an experiment, on my mark close your eyes-now and try read this next sentence. Without accessibility people who have sight impairments are not able to engage or interact with many facets of everyday life, even now unless you have super vision, or didn't close your eyes it would have been impossible to read this far. 
In a digital space there is a lot we as designers can do to facilitate and even accommodate people with disabilities so that they may share the same experiences as us regardless of any impairments. 
This is where accessibility comes in, designing with inclusivity in mind. 
Accessibility refers to measures that allow any and all people to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with a medium or their environment. <br></br>
<br>Okay, but why should *you* care?</br>
<br></br>
Picture this, you watch a movie in a foreign language, one that has no captions and no scenes spoken in your native tongue, chances are by the end you will walk out of the cinema knowing nothing. 
However, subtitles help translate and help us understand what characters are saying and what is going on. 
This is a form of accessibility, wherein the film, although, shot in a foreign language accommodates people who aren't familiar with the language by having subtitles. 
In a similar vein, people with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities should be taken into account when designing a website. There are multiple ways of doing it and it is something that needs to be heavily considered, as accessibility is something that also enhances usability, 
and more often than not can result in a much more intuitive user experience. 
<br>Okay great but what exactly is accessibility????</br>
Accessibility refers to facilitating people with disabilities AND allowing them to actively participate in our society. 
Now what's important to understand is that this does not only relate to digital spaces or even real life ones, instead, it is multi-faceted. 
Just how there are audio cues for the blind, there are similarly display options for video games like Call Of Duty. https://www.pcgamer.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-colorblind-options/ (Links to an external site.) 
The gaming space has actually improved and made many options for accessibility, of these is the colorblind options mentioned for Call Of Duty, however, as recent as 2020, Naughty Dog's The Last Of Us Part II, was praised for its multitude of accessibility options.
<br> “60+ settings make this Naughty Dog's most accessible game yet” (Gallant, 2020)</br>
Okay so now with all that in mind, how can you do better, and foster inclusivity? 
How to Improve Web Accessibility If approaching it from a user experience (UX) route, there is a fantastic guide designers/developers use to improve website accessibility 
(Universal Design Principles (Links to an external site.)) The benefits of this are that the disabled community can access a particular website with the help of assistive technology. 
The following are a few tips and key pointers that can also help build with inclusivity in mind. (Stardust Testing, 2022) Equitable Use: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. 
Flexibility in Use: The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. Simple & Intuitive Use: Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level. 
Perceptible Information: The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities. Tolerance for Error: The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. 
Low Physical Effort: The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue. Size and Space for approach and Use: Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility. And to end off, if in doubt a wonderful little pointer is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) (Links to an external site.) which can ensure people with a wide variety of disabilities can access and use sites, apps, etc.
