<h3>Mario's archenemy? Or Invaluable asset in naivgating the interwebs?</h3>

<p class="yellow-div"> What is a browser.

    Bowser, or King Koopa, is a fictional character, the primary antagonist in Nintendo's Mario franchise, and the archenemy of Mario. In Japan, the character bears the title of Daimaō. Bowser is the leader of the turtle-like Koopa race.
    
    End.
    
    No actually far from that, jokes aside, I think it is time to answer arguably one of, if not the most important aspect of the internet. What exactly is a browser, and how exactly do these strange technologies work? 
    <br></br>
    Browsers have an important role of functioning as an access point of sorts to the World Wide Web, 
    they are essentially our means of transport to the internet, but they’re also so much more.  
    <br></br>
    Since their ‘conception’ browsers have become silent helpers in our daily lives and given they’re a gateway to the internet and a browser such as Google deals with approximately 3.8 million searches per minute on average across the globe 
    it is no small feat to spend a day without using a browser at least once. 
    <br></br>
    However before we get into the nitty gritty of web browsers, 
    allow me to differentiate between this and a search engine as many often use the terms interchangeably. 
    The Internet is an endless sea of information & resources and to access these resources from the internet certain software programs known as 
    Search Engines are used. 
    From my understanding, a search engine can best be described as a website in which a user can search for any and all resources and material available on the Internet. To do this a user punches in keywords into the search field, thereafter the search engine looks through its index for web pages relating to the search query and then displays them in the form of a list of webpages. There consists of three distinct components of a web browser namely crawlers, an Index and a Search algorithm. 
    Crawlers are software programs sometimes referred to as spiderbots or bots. 
    <br></br>
    These do regular scans of websites for URLs, keywords, and links in order to optimize user experience. 
    Crawlers can follow links present on other webpages and given each crawler has their own unique identifier they are able to identify themselves to a web server. 
    Relating to crawlers are Indexes which use crawlers to continuously scan websites, and develop an index of URLs, links and keywords to make the search results more effective. Lastly, we have the search algorithm which is the final cog in the search process.
    It works by searching for the aforementioned index and finding webpages by matching.

    <br>Which brings us to the million dollar question, what are web browsers? </br>
    
    Often shortened to browser/s, a web browser is an example of a software program (application software) that allows a user to locate, access, and display web pages, browsers were developed to retrieve and view the information from web pages or HTML files present on the web servers.
     Web browsers consist of a G.U.I (Graphical User Interface) and a search bar where the user types the website’s address or URL. Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the very first web browser in 1990 and three years later the first graphical web browser was developed in 1993 which was named the Mosaic. 
     In the next few years multiple different web browsers were developed.
     
     <br> Examples of these are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera. And now for the two million dollar question, what do they do? 
     Well, the simple answer is that they function as a means of retrieving information from other parts of the web and displaying it for the user’s leisure. Now to elaborate on this a web browser “handles HTTP activity between a client and a server that is the backbone of World Wide Web use. URLs are traffic directions for the web browser, and the browser uses IP addresses and other tools to establish these connections. Along with facilitating web surfing, new types of web browsers have additional functionality through a range of plug-ins that can add features after the fact. Some of these have to do with security and accessibility, while others have to do with end user conveniences or data aggregation.”
